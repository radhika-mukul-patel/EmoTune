How do you do? Now you're going to die!"" Yeah, that's what I told him! Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes And he went down, but to my surprise He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear But I busted a chair right across his teeth And we crashed through the wall and into the street Kicking and a-gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer I tell you, I've fought tougher men But I really can't remember when He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss And he went for his gun and I pulled mine first He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile And he said, ""Son, this world is rough And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough And I knew I wouldn't be there to help you along So I give you that name and I said goodbye I knew you'd have to get tough or die And it's that name that helped to make you strong"" Yeah He said, ""Now you just fought one hell of a fight And I know you hate me, and you got the right To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do But you ought to thank me, before I die For the gravel in your guts and the spit in your eye Because I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue"" I got all choked up and I threw down my gun And I called him my pa, and he called me his son And I came away with a different point of view And I think about him, now and then Every time I try and every time I win And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him Bill or George!

Country,Johnny Cash,The Man Comes Around,"And I heard, as it were, the noise of thunder One of the four beasts saying, ""Come and see"" And I saw, and behold, a white horse There's a man going 'round taking names And he decides who to free and who to blame Everybody won't be treated all the same There'll be a golden ladder reaching down When the man comes around The hairs on your arm will stand up At the terror in each sip and in each sup Will you partake of that last offered cup? Or disappear into the potter's ground? When the man comes around Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers One hundred million angels singing Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum Voices calling, voices crying Some are born and some are dying It's Alpha and Omega's kingdom come And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree The virgins are all trimming their wicks The whirlwind is in the thorn tree It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks You might also like 'Til Armageddon, no salaam, no shalom Then the father hen will call his chickens home The wise men will bow down before the throne And at his feet they'll cast their golden crowns When the man comes around Whoever is unjust, let him be unjust still Whoever is righteous, let him be righteous still Whoever is filthy, let him be filthy still Listen to the words long written down When the man comes around Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers One hundred million angels singing Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum Voices calling, voices crying Some are born and some are dying It's Alpha and Omega's kingdom come And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree The virgins are all trimming their wicks The whirlwind is in the thorn tree It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks In measured hundredweight and penny pound When the man comes around And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts And I looked, and behold, a pale horse And his name, that sat on him, was Death And Hell followed with him"

EDM,Daft Punk,Giorgio by Moroder,"When I was fifteen, sixteen, when I really started to play guitar I definitely wanted to become a musician It was almost impossible because—it was—the dream was so big That I didn't see any chance because I was living in a little town; was studying And when I finally broke away from school and became a musician I thought, ""Well, now I may have a little bit of a chance"" Because all I really wanted to do is music And not only play music, but compose music At that time, in Germany, in '69, '70, they had already discotheques So, I would take my car, would go to a discotheque Sing maybe thirty minutes I think I had about seven, eight songs I would partially sleep in the car Because I didn't want to drive home and that helped me for about Almost two years to survive in the beginning I wanted to do an album with the sounds of the '50s The sounds of the '60s, of the '70s And then have a sound of the future And I said, ""Wait a second, I know the synthesizer Why don't I use the synthesizer which is the sound of the future?"" And I didn't have any idea what to do But I knew I needed a click, so we put a click on the 24-track Which then was synced to the Moog Modular I knew that could be a sound of the future But I didn't realize how much the impact would be My name is Giovanni Giorgio But everybody calls me Giorgio You might also like Once you free your mind about a concept of Harmony and of music being ""correct"" You can do whatever you want So, nobody told me what to do And there was no preconception of what to do"

Metal,Iron Maiden,Rime of the Ancient Mariner,"Hear the rime of the ancient Mariner See his eye as he stops one of three Mesmerises one of the wedding guests Stay here and listen to the nightmares of the sea And the music plays on, as the bride passes by Caught by a spell and the Mariner tells his tale Driven south to the land of the snow and ice To a place where nobody's been Through the snow, fog flies on the Albatross Hailed in God's name, hoping good luck it brings And the ship sails on, back to the north Through the fog and ice and the Albatross follows on The Mariner kills the bird of good omen His shipmates cry against what he's done But when the fog clears, they justify him And make themselves a part of the crime Sailing on and on and north across the sea Sailing on and on and north 'til all is calm You might also like The Albatross begins with its vengeance A terrible curse, a thirst has begun His shipmates blame bad luck on the Mariner About his neck, the dead bird is hung And the curse goes on and on and on at sea And the thirst goes on and on for them and me ""Day after day, day after day We stuck nor breath nor motion As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean Water, water everywhere, and all the boards did shrink Water, water everywhere nor any drop to drink"" ""There,"" calls the Mariner, ""There comes a ship o’er the line But how can she sail with no wind in her sails and no tide?"" See, onward she comes Onward she nears, out of the sun See, she has no crew She has no life, wait but there's two Death and she Life-in-Death They throw their dice for the crew She wins the Mariner and he belongs to her now Then, crew one by one They drop down dead, two hundred men She, she, Life-in-Death She lets him live, her chosen one ""One after one by the star-dogged Moon Too quick for groan or sigh Each turned his face with a ghastly pang And cursed me with his eye Four times fifty living men And I heard nor sigh nor groan With heavy thump, a lifeless lump They dropped down one by one."" The curse, it lives on in their eyes The Mariner he wished he'd die Along with the sea creatures But they lived on, so did he And by the light of the Moon He prays for their beauty, not doom With heart he blesses them God's creatures all of them too Then the spell starts to break The Albatross falls from his neck Sinks down like lead into the sea Then down in falls comes the rain Hear the groans of the long-dead seamen See them stir and they start to rise Bodies lifted by good spirits None of them speak and they're lifeless in their eyes And revenge still is sought, penance starts again Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on Now the curse is finally lifted And the Mariner sights his home Spirits go from the long-dead bodies Form their own light and the Mariner's left alone And then a boat came sailing towards him It was a joy he could not believe The Pilot's boat, his son, and the Hermit Penance of life will fall onto him And the ship, it sinks like lead into the sea And the Hermit shrieves the Mariner of his sins The Mariner's bound to tell of his story To tell this tale wherever he goes To teach God's word by his own example That we must love all things that God made And the Wedding guest's a sad and wiser man And the tale goes on and on and on and on"

Those sleepless nights on patrol roll call Tell me is it worth it all? One child smile while a next one bawl Tell me is it worth it? Is it worth it? Is it worth it all? And when a gunman makes choice I wonder what goes through a gunman's mind And does a gunman think twice? Before him takes another someone's life? I wonder what it is a gunman say To the Father when a gunman pray Does he kiss his kids to bed at night? Making sure the blanket tucked just right? Nothing no scary like a gunman voice When people beg a gunman think twice And him say no Wha coulda scary like a gunman voice When people beg a gunman think twice And him say no Can you tell me is it worth it all? If one don rise then a next must fall Tell me is it worth it all? Those sleepless nights on patrol roll call Tell me is it worth it all? One child smile while a next one bawl Tell me is it worth it? Is it worth it? Is it worth it all?"
